# hello-world
 Starting my career as a developer and my first steps on GitHub
 
Ok, I have started learning the Front End. Looking for the bases to be able to define my path, trying a little HTML, CSS and JS.
Watching and practicing with many courses on Youtube, Udemy, [in] learning, and others more.
I am too passionate about programming and seeing all the potential that some lines of code and our imagination have.
